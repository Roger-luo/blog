I'm writing a lattice package for physics: [Lattices.jl](https://github.com/Roger-luo/Lattices.jl)

For triangular/honeycomb lattices and some other lattices (like a 3-D lattice), a k-d tree will be applied to
search for **k-th nearrest neighbor**.

Then, I did a little search, there is one already in Julia: [NearestNeighbors.jl](https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl)

Ummm, but...
