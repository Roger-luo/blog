title: Implement Automatic Differentiation with Julia in ONE day
tags: automatic differentiation

I was playing with [AutoGrad.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/AutoGrad.jl) and [Zygote.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Zygote.jl), they both look
awesome, and AutoGrad.jl is already applied to the machine learning framework in Julia: [Knet.jl](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl). However,
when I tried to read the source code of AutoGrad.jl, it is not large indeed. And as a PyTorch contributor and user, I personally prefer some of PyTorch's interfaces, therefore, I tried to implemented my own automatic differentiation and it just took me one day to finished the core part (including broadcast!), although, I spent a few hours more in the next following days to polish the interface (a weekend to write a blog post). But it is actually quite easy to implement an automatic differentiation package in Julia.

I packed it to a package (YAAD.jl: Yet Another AD package for Julai) here: [Roger-luo/YAAD.jl](https://github.com/Roger-luo/YAAD.jl)

In this post, I'll introduce how did I implemented my own automatic differentiation, and maybe, you can build one of your own as well!

# Automatic Differentiation: A Brief Intro

There are generally two kinds of automatic differentiation: forward mode differentiation and reverse mode differentiation. What we need in deep learning (as well as tensor networks in physics) is the reverse mode differentiation, because the model we are going to optimize usually contains quite a lot parameters. This is also called as back-propagation and requires something called comput-graph.

### Comput-Graph

*To illustrate this, I stealed some nice picture and re-plot them in animation from cs5740, 2017sp, Cornell.*

Say we are calculating the following expression:

$$
y = \mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}\\cdot \mathbf{x} + c
$$

We will need to call several functions in Julia to get the result $y$, which is

1. $\mathbf{z_1} = \mathbf{x}^T$: `transpose` function.
2. $\mathbf{z_2} = \mathbf{z_1} A$ matrix-vector multiplication, which can be `gemv` in `LinearAlgebra.BLAS`, or just `*`.
3. $y1 = \mathbf{z2} \mathbf{x}$ vector dot operation, which is `LinearAlgebra.dot` or the UTF-8 operator `x â‹… y`
4. $y2 = \mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{x}$ another vector dot
5. $y_1 + y_2 + c$ a scalar add function, one can calculate it by simply calling `+` operator in Julia.

In fact, we can draw a graph of this expression, which illustrates the relationship between each variable in this expression.
Each node in the graph with a output arrow represents a variable and each node with a input arrow represents a function/operator.

![comput-graph](/images/comput-graph-forward.gif)

The evaluation of the math equation above can then be expressed as a process called **forward evaluation**, it starts from the leaf nodes, which represents the inputs of the whole expression, e.g they are $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b}, c$ in our expression. Each time, we receive the value of a node in the graph, we mark the node with **green**.

Now, let's calculate the gradients with [**chain rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule), the number of gradients returned by each function is the same with their inputs. We mark the node with red color if we receive a gradient, the gradient will be back propagated through the graph, which is called **back propagation** or **backward evaluation**.

![comput-graph](/images/comput-graph-backward.gif)

### Dynamic Comput Graph VS Static Comput Graph

Although, the way of forward evaluation and backward evaluation are actually the same, but for implementation, we can construct the graph on the fly (like [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)) or statically declaration (like [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)).

Generally, the difference between them is that:

**whether to define the graph before the forward evaluation happens or along with the forward evaluation.**

I'm a PyTorch syntax lover, so I'm going to implement my AD as a dynamic constructed graph. But I'm also planning to write a macro in Julia that "freeze" a dynamic graph to static graph, because in principle, static graph is easier to optimize, since we will be able to access the whole graph before evaluation happens, which allows us to dispatch methods statically, but it can be hard to debug for static graphs.

## Define the Nodes in Computational Graph

Well, before we start writing something concrete, we can first define an `abstract type` for all nodes we are going to define:

```julia
abstract type AbstractNode end
```

### Leaf Nodes

Same, define an `abstract type` first.

```julia
abstract type LeafNode <: AbstractNode end
```

In PyTorch, a `Variable` is a multi-dimensional array (tensor) with a gradient (also store in a multi-dimensional array of the same size and data type). And it will accumulate the gradient if we backward propagate the graph for multiple times.

Accumulating is useful sometimes, when you want to calculate the expectation of the gradient, or manipulating a batch of data, but not always useful. But anyway, we have an abstract type, we can define different flavored leaf nodes later.

```julia
mutable struct Variable{T} <: LeafNode
    value::T
    grad::T

    Variable(val::T) where T = new{T}(val)
    Variable(val::T, grad::T) where T = new{T}(val)
end
```

Here, we use [in-complete initialization](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/constructors/#Incomplete-Initialization-1), since we don't really need to allocate a memory for the gradient at the beginning, we can just use a temporary memory later.

### Other Nodes

Well, now we have some leaf nodes, but we need to store operations and their output for later use, so firstly, I define something called `Node`

```julia
struct Node{FT <: Function, ArgsT <: Tuple, KwargsT <: NamedTuple} <: AbstractNode
    f::FT
    args::ArgsT
    kwargs::KwargsT
end
```

It is a subtype of `AbstractNode`, and it stores a function call's arguments and keywords. However, we will need to consider
`broadcast` and normal function calls, they are actually different, therefore we should not directly store the function, thus, let's write some `traits`:

```julia
abstract type Operator end

module Trait
import YAAD: Operator

struct Method{FT} <: Operator
    f::FT
end

struct Broadcasted{FT} <: Operator
    f::FT
end
end # Trait
```

Now we change `Function` to `Operator`

```julia
struct Node{FT <: Operator, ArgsT <: Tuple, KwargsT <: NamedTuple} <: AbstractNode
    f::FT
    args::ArgsT
    kwargs::KwargsT
end
```

And we may make some constructors for convenience, since most `f` will be a method call rather than broadcast or self-defined
operator, and we usually don't need the keyword arguments either:

```julia
# wrap function to Method
Node(f::Function, args, kwargs) = Node(Trait.Method(f), args, kwargs)
Node(op, args) = Node(op, args, NamedTuple())
```

In fact, `Node` is actually just a trait for some object (some subtype of `Operator`), we haven't
define any type that store the output of each node in the graph, so here let's define a `CachedNode`
which will cache the forward evaluation result of `Node`:

```julia
mutable struct CachedNode{NT <: AbstractNode, OutT} <: AbstractNode
    node::NT
    output::OutT
end
```

So, what we want this `CachedNode` do, is that we want it to store the forward evaluation result of a `Node`:

```julia
function CachedNode(f, args...; kwargs...)
    node = Node(f, args, kwargs.data) # this constructs a Node
    output = forward(node)
    CachedNode(node, output)
end
```

## Evaluations

evaluation is the most important part, because we want to define our rules of evaluation in an extensible way, and
try to make it efficient. Luckily, in Julia, we have **multiple dispatch**! Let's make use of it!

### Forward Evaluation

But how to **forward evaluate** a `Node`? this depends what kind of method is implemented for this generic function `forward`:


1. if input is a `Node`, we re-dispatch this method to its operator's forward method (while forward evaluates the `args` and `kwargs`):

```julia
forward(node::Node) = forward(node.f, map(forward, node.args)...; map(forward, node.kwargs)...)
```

This will allow us to tweak the forward evaluation by simply implement a method for generic function `forward`, e.g, if we don't want to directly calculate the result of a linear operator $\mathbf{W}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}$ rather than store two nodes separately (a matrix-vector multiplication `*` and a add function `+`).

```julia
struct Linear <: Operator
  w::Matrix{Float64}
  b::Vector{Float64}
end

forward(op::Linear, x::Vector{Float64}) = op.w * x + b
```

2. if input is a `CachedNode`, this means our user is evaluating this node for second time (since we calculate the result when construct it), we will update its output

```julia
forward(node::CachedNode) = (node.output = forward(node.node))
```

3. However, for simple function calls, we don't want to write something like

```julia
function forward(::Method{typeof(sin)}, x)
  sin(x)
end
```

each time, let's make it simpler, by re-dispatching an operator's `forward` method to a function call:

```julia
forward(op::Operator, args...; kwargs...) = op.f(args...; kwargs...)
```

This means, as long as, the operator defines its own call method, it does not need to implement a method for `forward`, e.g

We can just define the call method for `Linear` rather than define method for `forward`:

```julia
(op::Linear)(x::Vector) = op.w * x + b
```

4. There could be some constants in the `Node`, e.g when we call `Variable(2.0) + 1.0`, this `1.0` is actually a constant, therefore, we can just return it self, when the input is not part of the computational graph (not subtype of `AbstractNode`) and define a default method for `AbstractNode` for better error messages.

```
forward(x) = x
forward(x::NT) where {NT <: AbstractNode} = error("forward method is not implemented for node type: $NT")
```

5. For leaf nodes, they should directly return their value, but we might use other kind of leaf node to make non-PyTorch lover
happy in the future, so let's define a generic function `value` for get this property:

```julia
value(x) = x

function value(x::T) where {T <: AbstractNode}
    error(
        "Expected value in this node $x of type $T ",
        "check if you defined a non-cached node",
        " or overload value function for your node."
    )
end

value(x::Variable) = x.value
value(x::CachedNode) = value(x.output)
```

And leaf nodes' `forward` directly return its value:

```julia
forward(node::LeafNode) = value(node)
```

Okay! we have defined all we need for `forward` evaluation, now let's try to implement backward evaluation.

### Backward Evaluation

The backward evaluation is actually similar to forward evaluation, we will call backward recursively on each node and its `args` (no, I'm not going to support `backward` on `kwargs` here, XD).

Firstly, for `LeafNode`, this is simple, e.g `Variable` will just take the `grad`

```julia
function backward(x::Variable, grad)
    if isdefined(x, :grad)
        x.grad += grad
    else
        x.grad = grad
    end
    nothing
end
```

We will check if this `grad` member is defined (it is in-complete initialized!), if it is not, we will just use the memory of
this gradient, or we add it to current gradient, just like PyTorch's `Variable` (or `Tensor` after v0.4).

And now, we need to define how to backward evaluation a `CachedNode`:

1. we gather the gradients of inputs from a function called `gradient`
2. we put each corresponding gradient to sub-node of current node and call their `backward`

```julia
function backward(node::CachedNode, f, grad)
    grad_inputs = gradient(node, grad)
    for (each, each_grad) in zip(args(node), grad_inputs)
        backward(each, each_grad)
    end
    nothing
end
```

Oh, you might want to add some assertion to output better error message here, we will check the type of gradient and output and also their size here, in most cases, gradient should have the exact same
type and size with output:

```julia
backward_type_assert(node::CachedNode{<:AbstractNode, T}, grad::T) where T = true
backward_type_assert(node::CachedNode{<:AbstractNode, T1}, grad::T2) where {T1, T2} =
    error("Gradient is expected to have the same",
          " type with outputs, expected $T1",
          " got $T2")
```

but for subtype of `AbstractArray`, we can just allow them to have the same static parameter (tensor rank and data type), because we will probably dealing with `SubArray` and `Array` for some operators, which does not really matters

```julia
# exclude arrays
backward_type_assert(node::CachedNode{<:AbstractNode, T1}, grad::T2) where
    {T, N, T1 <: AbstractArray{T, N}, T2 <: AbstractArray{T, N}} = true
```

Finally we check the size of gradients and output

```julia
function backward_size_assert(node::CachedNode, grad)
    size(node.output) == size(grad) ||
        error(
            "gradient should have the same size with output,",
            " expect size $(size(node.output)), got $(size(grad))"
        )
end
```

In Julia, the bounds check can be turned off by compiler option, we sometimes don't actually need to check bounds in runtime
so we put this assertion in `@boundscheck`, so it will looks like:

```julia
function backward(node::CachedNode, f, grad)
    backward_type_assert(node, grad)
    # TODO: replace with @assert when there is a compiler option for it
    @boundscheck backward_size_assert(node, grad)

    grad_inputs = gradient(node, grad)
    for (each, each_grad) in zip(args(node), grad_inputs)
        backward(each, each_grad)
    end
    nothing
end
```

OK, now, let's think about how to return the gradient, I would prefer our AD be highly extensible by Julia's **multiple dispatch**, and I will only need to define the gradient by define different methods for `gradient`, e.g

```julia
gradient(::typeof(sin), grad, output, x) = grad * cos(x)
```

This can be implemented in the same way of `forward`: re-dispatch the method to different syntax:

```julia
gradient(x::CachedNode, grad) = gradient(x.node.f, grad, x.output, map(value, x.node.args)...; map(value, x.node.kwargs)...)
```

We here dispatch the `gradient` of a `CachedNode` directly to a method implemented for `Operator`, but the same with `forward`
we don't want to write `Method` trait each time, re-dispatch it again

```julia
gradient(x::Operator, grad, output, args...; kwargs...) =
    gradient(x.f, grad, output, args...; kwargs...)
```

Finally, define a default error massage:

```julia
gradient(fn, grad, output, args...; kwargs...) =
    error(
        "gradient of operator $fn is not defined\n",
        "Possible Fix:\n",
        "define one of the following:\n",
        "1. gradient(::typeof($fn), grad, output, args...; kwargs...)\n",
        "2. gradient(op::Trait.Method{typeof($fn)}, grad, output, args...; kwargs...)\n",
        "3. gradient(op::Trait.Broadcasted{typeof($fn)}, grad, output, args...; kwargs...)\n"
    )
```

So in this way, when we implement a specific method of some types for `gradient`, Julia will auto dispatch gradient to that method, e.g

```julia
# I re-define this Linear here, since we need to store the gradient
struct Linear <: Operator
  w::Variable{Matrix{Float64}}
  b::Variable{Vector{Float64}}
end

function gradient(op::Linear, grad, output, x)
  grad_w, grad_b = # some gradient expression to calculate the gradient of w and b
  backward(op.w, grad_w) # update gradient of w
  backward(op.w, grad_b) # update gradient of b

  grad_input = # calculate the gradient of input
  grad_input # return the gradient of input
end
```

Umm, and finally, I would like to have an eye-candy function for construct a node (but this depends on you, it is not actually necessay):

```julia
register(f, args...; kwargs...) = CachedNode(f, args...; kwargs...)
```

Okay, let's try to register an operator now!

```julia
Base.sin(x::AbstractNode) = register(Base.sin, x)
gradient(::typeof(Base.sin), grad, output, x) = (grad * cos(x), )
```

**remember we assumed gradient returns several gradients**, the return of `gradient` has to be an iteratable of gradients.

## Broadcast

However, the above gradients for scalars, this will just work. It won't work for arrays, we will need to re-dispatch broadcast in Julia.

Let me introduce some basic concepts of the interface of broadcast in Julia first, and then we will find a quite easy way
to implement AD for broadcast:

All the broadcast mechanism is implemented in a module `Broadcast` in `Base`, each different type has its own `BroadcastStyle` (this is a trait). So what we need to do, is just to implement our own broadcast style and construct a
`CachedNode` instead directly broadcasting the operation.

```julia
struct ComputGraphStyle <: Broadcast.BroadcastStyle end
Base.BroadcastStyle(::Type{<:AbstractNode}) = ComputGraphStyle()
Broadcast.BroadcastStyle(s::ComputGraphStyle, x::Broadcast.BroadcastStyle) = s
```

However, this is not enough, in Julia broadcast is lazy evaluated, which can fuse broadcast and provide better performance, we need to re-dispatch two interface: `broadcasted` and `materialize`

```julia
function Broadcast.broadcasted(::ComputGraphStyle, f, args...)
    mt = Trait.Broadcasted(f)
    register(mt, args...)
end

Broadcast.materialize(x::AbstractNode) = register(Broadcast.materialize, x)
```

And we let `materialize` directly forward the gradient during backward evaluation:

```julia
function backward(node::CachedNode, ::typeof(Broadcast.materialize), grad)
    backward_type_assert(node, grad)
    @boundscheck backward_size_assert(node, grad)
    backward(node.node.args[1], grad) # materialize only has one arguments, we don't need the for loop
end
```

Now, if you try to broadcast with this AD, you would find that the assertion we defined in `backward` is quite annoying (because lazy evaluation, its output is not actually the real output, but a middle type), let's mute them for broadcast:

```julia
function backward(node::CachedNode, ::Trait.Broadcasted, grad)
    grad_inputs = gradient(node, grad)
    for (each, each_grad) in zip(args(node), grad_inputs)
        backward(each, each_grad)
    end
    nothing
end
```

## Add more operators for FREE!

There is a Julia package called `DiffRules`, it contains quite a lot differentiation rules defined as Julia `Expr`, so we can just use code generation to generate operators with it rather than define them ourselves:

The rules are in `DiffRules.DEFINED_DIFFRULES`, so we will just iterate through its key

```julia
for (mod, name, nargs) in keys(DiffRules.DEFINED_DIFFRULES)
  # code generation
end
```

the first argument `mod` is the module's name, like for `sin`, it is actually in `Base`, so the `mod` is `Base` and
`name` is the function's name, `nargs` means the number of arguments, in `DiffRules`, there are only single argument functions
and double arguments functions.

So the code generation will looks like

```julia
for (mod, name, nargs) in keys(DiffRules.DEFINED_DIFFRULES)
    f_ex_head = Expr(:., mod, QuoteNode(name))

    if nargs == 1
        df_ex = DiffRules.diffrule(mod, name, :x)

        name === :abs && continue # exclude abs, it cannot be directly broadcasted

        @eval begin
            $(f_ex_head)(x::AbstractNode) = register($(f_ex_head), x)
            gradient(::typeof($(f_ex_head)), grad, output, x) = (grad * $df_ex, )
            gradient(mt::Trait.Broadcasted{typeof($f_ex_head)}, grad, output, x) = (@.(grad * $(df_ex)), )
        end
    elseif nargs == 2
        df_ex = DiffRules.diffrule(mod, name, :x, :y)

        @eval begin

            $(f_ex_head)(x1::AbstractNode, x2) = register($f_ex_head, x1, x2)
            $(f_ex_head)(x1, x2::AbstractNode) = register($f_ex_head, x1, x2)
            $(f_ex_head)(x1::AbstractNode, x2::AbstractNode) = register($f_ex_head, x1, x2)

            gradient(::typeof($f_ex_head), grad, output, x, y) =
                (grad * $(df_ex[1]), grad * $(df_ex[2]))
            gradient(::Trait.Broadcasted{typeof($f_ex_head)}, grad, output, x, y) =
                (@.(grad * ($(df_ex[1]))), @.(grad * $(df_ex[2])))
        end
    else
        @info "unknown operator $name"
    end
end
```

For how to use code generation in Julia, I would suggest the official documentation for understanding more about it: [Code Generation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/#Code-Generation-1). I escape `abs` here because the differentiation expression of `abs` generated by `DiffRules` can not be directly broadcasted by `@.` (this macro add a broadcast mark `.` to every function call), so I have to implement its gradient manually. But `DiffRules` will generate most of the math function's gradient for you!

## Polish

We roughly implemented the core functionality of an AD, but there's still quite a lot to do to make it looks and feels better.

I defined better printing later here: [show.jl](https://github.com/Roger-luo/YAAD.jl/blob/master/src/show.jl), the basic idea is to re-dispatch our nodes via several traits, so we can insert a type into other type tree, e.g as subtype of `AbstractArray` and then make use of existing printing methods.

Then, to implement unit test, I copied the `gradcheck` function from `PyTorch`, which will calculate the jacobian of an operator with the AD package and compare it with numerical jacobian.

## Benchmark

Okay, it is done! With about only 200~300 lines Julia, what can we get? Actually, I thought it would be just a toy, but
it is amazing, when I tried to use it for my own work:

So I need to calculate something called [matrix product state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state), well, I'm going to talk about quantum physics, so it is just some rank-3 tensors (3 dimensional array), and we will need to calculate something like the following expression:

```julia
tr(x1 * x2 * x3)
```

where `x1`, `x2`, `x3` are just matrix.

So I implemented the gradient of `tr` and matrix multiplication:

```julia
Base.:(*)(lhs::AbstractNode, rhs) = register(Base.:(*), lhs, rhs)
Base.:(*)(lhs, rhs::AbstractNode) = register(Base.:(*), lhs, rhs)
Base.:(*)(lhs::AbstractNode, rhs::AbstractNode) = register(Base.:(*), lhs, rhs)

using LinearAlgebra

LinearAlgebra.tr(x::AbstractNode) = register(LinearAlgebra.tr, x)
gradient(::typeof(tr), grad, output, x) = (grad * Matrix(I, size(x)), )

function gradient(::typeof(*), grad, output, lhs::AbstractVecOrMat, rhs::AbstractVecOrMat)
    grad * transpose(rhs), transpose(lhs) * grad
end
```

Now let's benchmark `tr(x1 * x2)` on CPU with other packages, with the following function call

```julia
Zygote.@grad LinearAlgebra.tr(x) = LinearAlgebra.tr(x), Î”-> (Î” * Matrix(I, size(x)), )

function bench_tr_mul_yaad(x1, x2)
    z = tr(x1 * x2)
    YAAD.backward(z)
    x1.grad, x2.grad
end

function bench_tr_mul_autograd(x1, x2)
    z = AutoGrad.@diff tr(x1 * x2)
    AutoGrad.grad(z, x1), AutoGrad.grad(z, x2)
end

function bench_tr_mul_zygote(x1, x2)
    Zygote.gradient((x1, x2)->tr(x1 * x2), x1, x2)
end
```

and in PyTorch (our interface is quite similar to PyTorch, isn't it?)

```python
def bench_tr_mul_torch(x1, x2):
    z = torch.trace(torch.matmul(x1, x2))
    z.backward()
    return x1.grad, x2.grad
```

In Julia, we use `BenchmarkTools` to measure the time, and in Python we can use the magic command `timeit` in ipython.

The value is defined as follows

```julia
xv, yv = rand(30, 30), rand(30, 30)
yaad_x, yaad_y = YAAD.Variable(xv), YAAD.Variable(yv)
autograd_x, autograd_y = AutoGrad.Param(xv), AutoGrad.Param(yv)
```

Before we benchmark other packages, I also write a baseline function, which calculate the gradient manually:

```julia
function bench_tr_mul_base(x1, x2)
    z1 = x1 * x2
    z2 = tr(z1)

    grad_z1 = Matrix{eltype(z1)}(I, size(z1))
    grad_z1 * transpose(x2), transpose(x1) * grad_z1
end
```

And then test it with `@benchmark`, which will run this function for multiple times

```julia

and for PyTorch (version v0.4.1)

```ipython
In [4]: x = torch.rand(30, 30, dtype=torch.float64, requires_grad=True)

In [5]: y = torch.rand(30, 30, dtype=torch.float64, requires_grad=True)

In [6]: %timeit bench_tr_mul_torch(x, y)
76.8 Âµs Â± 1.68 Âµs per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```

Our implementation is not bad, huh? Only about 4~5 Î¼s slower than the baseline due to the dynamic construction of our computational graph in runtime.

So, as you see, writing an AD package can be super sweet in Julia with multiple dispatch. You can actually write your own AD with a reasonable performance in Julia like a pro!
